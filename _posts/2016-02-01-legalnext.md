description: "A law firm has a corporate insurance company as a client.  This insurance company requires invoices to be in a specific format and use certain codes, langauge, etc or it would write off invoice line items.  I wrote a program that automated the process of transforming and standardinzing their invoice preparation without changing their existing workflow.  Saves them over 48 hours a month."
