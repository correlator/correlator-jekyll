description: "A company that makes online travel guides collects a lot of information about activities across the US but this information is often conflicting or incorrect.  They wanted to hire cheap help to validate all of this data, but with all of the potential places data could be wrong, help was hard to find.  We created a system where they can import all of their data and pass it through a rules engine that autodetects suspect data.  It then broke all of the potential data conflicts into multiple different single purpose tasks such as “Add an address”, “Fix conflicting names”, “Add Quotes”, “Validate Google Places ID”, etc. "
