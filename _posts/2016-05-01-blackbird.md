description: "Working under Emendo ApS and Blackbird ApS we helped build out the cloud infrastructure for an internet of things sensor company.  They create cell network connected boxes that send data from factory sensors straight to the cloud for use anywhere on any device.  Also did very mild programming of hardware to allow use of different SIM cards."
