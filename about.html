    Corlay Was founded in 2015 by Scott Hoch with a goal of helping companies figure out how technology can most
    efficiently help meet their goals.  Since then Corellator has worked with over 9 different organizations in 4 different countries.
    Scott's background in physics, venture backed startups, and starting a data driven
    Amazon business drive a culture that emphasizes paring the right technology for the right problem.  We often
    turn away customers who would be better served with a Shopify store or Squarespace site.
