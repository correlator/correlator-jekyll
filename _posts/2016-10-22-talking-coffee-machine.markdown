description: "Built a talking coffee machine prototype for an Amazon seller.  The device consisted of an iPhone app which sent voice data to the WIT API.  Built and trained a rules engine in WIT and sent results to a Particle Photon over wireless internet.  The particle photon controlled 2 motors for cream and sugar.  It also controlled a Kureg coffee machine."
